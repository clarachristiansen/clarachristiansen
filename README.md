### Hi!
My name is Clara and I am currently pursuing my Master's engineering degree in "Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence" at the Technical University of Denmark.

I enjoy working with real-world datasets, solving complex problems, and making solutions work in practice.
This GitHub is where I keep projects and experiments from my studies and spare time. Naturally, not all of my projects are publicly available.
